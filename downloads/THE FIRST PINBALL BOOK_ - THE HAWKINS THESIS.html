</span>by Russ Jensen</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was the first book on the subject of pinball machines? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Many</pre><pre>pin-fans would tell you it was "The Illustrated History of Pinball" by</pre><pre>Canadian author Michael Colmer which was published in 1976 (there was a</pre><pre>company produced booklet called "Coin Operated Amusement" by Bally</pre><pre>advertising manager Herb Jones - which contained a section on pinball and</pre><pre>its history - put out around 1972, but that was really not a "book" and</pre><pre>was put out by Bally to try to sell their products to the Italians). </pre><pre>Around the same time as Colmer was released, a college thesis was compiled</pre><pre>in Los Angeles and could possibly be regarded as "the first pinball book".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which actually came out first (the thesis or Colmer's book) I am</pre><pre>not certain, but at any rate I believe the thesis was certainly a "pioneer</pre><pre>work" on pinball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The thesis, titled "History of The Pinball Machine", was</pre><pre>written by Robert LeBrun Hawkins, and published in August 1976 in partial</pre><pre>fulfillment of the requirements for a Master of Arts degree in Industrial</pre><pre>Studies at California State University, Los Angeles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will attempt to</pre><pre>describe in some detail the contents of this document which represent an</pre><pre>early attempt at describing the early historical background of this</pre><pre>fascinating amusement device.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before I begin describing this scholarly work I believe a few</pre><pre>words are in order concerning how I heard about the thesis, got acquainted</pre><pre>with its author, and subsequently obtained a personal copy of the</pre><pre>document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I began collecting pinball machines in the mid-1970's, and by</pre><pre>the later part of that decade was really "getting into it".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the</pre><pre>acquaintances I had made at that time was a young coin machine collector</pre><pre>named Dave Makekran.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One time while talking with him on the telephone he</pre><pre>just happened to mention that an old high school buddy of his had published</pre><pre>a thesis on the history of pinball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He told me his friend's name was Rob</pre><pre>Hawkins and gave me his phone number in Los Angeles.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That news really excited me and I called Rob almost immediately. </pre><pre>He told me yes, he had written such a thesis and gave me all the</pre><pre>particulars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I next called my good friend Ron Tyler who was a professor at</pre><pre>another university (and also a pinball fan) and asked him if he could help</pre><pre>in getting a copy of Rob's thesis?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through his university library Ron was</pre><pre>able to borrow a copy of the thesis and we embarked on a project of copying</pre><pre>it.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I took the borrowed copy to a local copy shop (in fact it took</pre><pre>about three visits) and carefully made two copies of its over 200 pages</pre><pre>(one copy for me and one for Ron).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only problem was that the "second</pre><pre>generation" copies of the illustrations didn't come out too well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,</pre><pre>when I called Rob Hawkins and told him about that he graciously agreed to</pre><pre>loan me his "original" illustrations to copy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was much better!</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final step was to have the whole thing bound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, Ron Tyler</pre><pre>was able, through his university, to have both copies professionally bound,</pre><pre>along with other theses from his university.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The final product looked like</pre><pre>a real hard-bound book (gold embossed title on the binding, etc.)!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And</pre><pre>that's how I (and Ron too) got a copy of what might be called "the world's</pre><pre>first pinball book"!</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that Rob Hawkins and I became good friends (and still are). </pre><pre>Shortly afterwards Rob met (actually it was through me) another young man,</pre><pre>Don Mueting, who was trying to compile a listing of all the pinball</pre><pre>machines ever made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The two of them (with help from others - including</pre><pre>myself) eventually published a small book in 1979 titled "Pinball Reference</pre><pre>Guide" which contained<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>an alphabetical listing of over 2500 pingames (from</pre><pre>the 1930's up to the date of publication) with reference to manufacturer,</pre><pre>date of release, and historical notes.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was followed in 1992 by a much improved and expanded work</pre><pre>called "Pinball Collector's Resource" which is also out of print now, but</pre><pre>Don and Rob are even now working on a significant update to that work! </pre><pre>Rob, by the way, is a high school teacher, formerly teaching Industrial</pre><pre>Arts, but now mostly Computer Science courses, I believe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now to the</pre><pre>thesis!</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob's thesis is divided into six chapters, an extensive</pre><pre>Bibliography, and three Appendices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will now attempt to describe in some</pre><pre>detail the contents of these.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre>CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob began by remarking that over the centuries man has devised</pre><pre>various ways to amuse himself - ranging from "spontaneous inspirations" to</pre><pre>"elaborately planned extravaganzas".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went on to comment that due to the</pre><pre>Industrial Revolution man began utilizing his mechanical knowledge and new</pre><pre>forms of energy to construct amusement devices by the late 19th and early</pre><pre>20th Century, sometimes attaching coin activating devices to them producing</pre><pre>"coin-operated amusement devices".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After briefly describing an ancient Greek device which dispensed</pre><pre>Holy Water when a coin was inserted, he told how coin-controlled vending</pre><pre>machines flourished in modern times, adding that coin-operated "amusement</pre><pre>devices" were also used in carnivals, etc., during the early 1900's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After</pre><pre>noting that the longest lived coin-op amusement device was the "five ball</pre><pre>pinball machine", Rob said that the U.S. pinball industry has been "very</pre><pre>volatile over the years" due to many diverse factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented</pre><pre>that there had recently been a surge in the number of pingames in the Los</pre><pre>Angeles area, due to a recent change in the local law banning such games,</pre><pre>then remarking that there currently was a lack of published works on that</pre><pre>area of the amusement industry.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that point Rob began to state "the problem" he was trying to</pre><pre>solve with his thesis - "to produce a single comprehensive work related to</pre><pre>the history of the amusement device known as the pinball machine".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then</pre><pre>stated that its purpose "was to compile pertinent date regarding the</pre><pre>origin and evolution of the pinball machine from its inception in 1929 to</pre><pre>its present state".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then stated two limitations of his study: 1) the study would</pre><pre>only cover the "5-ball pinball machine" and exclude other similar games</pre><pre>using balls, and 2) the discussion of the "legal problems" faced by pinball</pre><pre>would be limited to the situations in Los Angeles and New York City.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A fairly extensive "Definition of Terms" section was next provided</pre><pre>describing the special terms used in the thesis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by the</pre><pre>definition of the "organization of the study", providing a brief</pre><pre>description of what was going to be presented in each chapter.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre>CHAPTER 2 - REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chapter began with Rob telling how acquisition of his<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>first</pre><pre>pinball game (Gottlieb's SITTIN' PRETTY - 1958) inspired him to search for</pre><pre>information on the history of that type of game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told of</pre><pre>performing several "library searches" which led to little except to a book</pre><pre>on the history of vending - but that did not mention coin-op games.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, Rob went on, he tried searching the "Reader's Guide to</pre><pre>Periodical Literature", which at first yielded little, but he finally</pre><pre>discovered a magazine article titled "Mother Was a Pinball Machine" which</pre><pre>gave some historical background information on pinball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said he</pre><pre>discovered from this (for one thing) that pinball probably evolved from the</pre><pre>early game called "Bagatelle" - also discovering that the entertainment</pre><pre>industry publication, THE BILLBOARD, was a source of additional information</pre><pre>on the game.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further reference to Reader's Guide, Rob commented, led to</pre><pre>additional magazine articles. as well as expanding his "topic list" (which</pre><pre>was contained in an Appendix to the thesis) which allowed his literature</pre><pre>search to be expanded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented that another reference work "The</pre><pre>Business Periodicals Index" led him to other articles as well.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At that point Rob talked about searching a reference called "Index</pre><pre>to Legal Periodicals" and finding numerous articles concerning legal</pre><pre>problems involving both pinballs and slot machines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then quoted from</pre><pre>one typical article from "The North Carolina Law Review" titled "Gaming -</pre><pre>Illegal Slot Machines - 'Silent Salesmen'".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob commented that "amusement</pre><pre>as a 'thing of value'" was "a battle often fought in the courts".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The subject of "trade journals" was next discussed as a source of</pre><pre>information regarding pingames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two of the best, Billboard and The</pre><pre>Marketplace ("The Confidential Newsletter of the Industry") were then</pre><pre>described in detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following that, three other lesser sources were</pre><pre>listed.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After briefly describing newspaper articles from both Los Angeles</pre><pre>and New York City, as sources of information for the thesis, the chapter</pre><pre>ended with a brief summary.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre>CHAPTER 3 - THE BACKGROUND AND EARLY HISTORY OF THE PINBALL MACHINE</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob began the chapter with a section called "Linking Pinball to</pre><pre>the Past".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He began that section by telling of one author who said that</pre><pre>the origins of pinball were possibly linked to an early Greek game in which</pre><pre>stones were rolled up a hill trying to land them in holes dug there.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The more likely linking of pinball to the 19th Century game of</pre><pre>Bagatelle was next discussed (the linking of that game to stone rolling was</pre><pre>even mentioned, however) - it even being pointed out that some early</pre><pre>pingames were referred to as "bagatelles".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The game of Bagatelle was</pre><pre>described as "a game played with balls and cues on a special table ... with</pre><pre>consecutively numbered holes ... with the highest numbers in the center."</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A political cartoon was shown portraying Abraham Lincoln playing</pre><pre>Bagatelle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After describing a reference to that game in Dickens' "PIckwick</pre><pre>Papers", Rob provided a reference to a book describing Bagatelle in greater</pre><pre>detail, as well as a reference to a similar game called Tivoli.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That game was described as being very similar to early pinball</pre><pre>games, except that the ball was shoved with a stick, and it was not coin</pre><pre>operated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a detailed description of that game, an illustration was</pre><pre>shown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At that point the similarities of these early games to pinball were</pre><pre>stated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those included: 1) the semi-circular shape of the top arch, and 2)</pre><pre>the board contained numbered holes for the balls to land in for scoring.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next related a story as to the origin of pinball from a 1935</pre><pre>Louisville, Kentucky newspaper regarding a man taking an old bagatelle</pre><pre>board and fixing it up for his childrens' Christmas gift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then pointed</pre><pre>out certain 'flaws' in the story, and declared it to be "the product of the</pre><pre>journalist's imagination".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After commenting how the definition of the term</pre><pre>"bagatelle" has varied somewhat over the years, a child's game (similar to</pre><pre>Bagatelle) called "Steeple Chase" was illustrated along with its detailed</pre><pre>"Instruction Sheet".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section of the chapter, "Early Pinball Machines",</pre><pre>described in detail the most well-known of the early pinball-like games,</pre><pre>attempting to answer the basic question "what was the first pinball game"?</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first game to be described was the counter-top turn-of-the-</pre><pre>century game called LOG CABIN, which Rob began by saying was "probably the</pre><pre>earliest machine to have similarities to the pinball machine of today".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It</pre><pre>was then remarked that the estimates of its date of production seem to</pre><pre>vary between as early as 1884 and as late as 1910.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next quoted from a publication titled "Tilt" (which was a</pre><pre>'catalog' for a traveling exposition of pinball and pinball art occurring</pre><pre>in Canada in 1975) describing LOG CABIN as being made by pioneer coin</pre><pre>machine producers Adolph and Arthur Caille in 1898.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That article referred</pre><pre>to it as "the first prototype of the pinball machine".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The quoted article further described the game in some detail as "a</pre><pre>plain cast metal case covered by a glass plate shielding a playfield dotted</pre><pre>with holes representing scores and obstructed by metal pins".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The play was</pre><pre>then described as "for a nickel a player shot a marble onto the field</pre><pre>trying to land in a high-scoring hole to win a prize".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The author of that</pre><pre>article ended by remarking that the game was not widely distributed, not</pre><pre>very popular,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and soon disappeared from the market.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next told of another article (from a publication called Famous</pre><pre>First Facts) describing "the first pinball machine (toy)" as LOG TAVERN</pre><pre>built in 1910 by the Caille brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hawkins next speculated on whether</pre><pre>the two writers were referring to the same game with some of the facts</pre><pre>being mixed up, or if the second game was really a "toy" with s similar</pre><pre>name?</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that point an article describing LOG CABIN by long-time coin</pre><pre>machine historian, writer, and publisher Bill Gersh was quoted from in</pre><pre>detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After briefly describing the game, Bill stated that he had found a</pre><pre>'circular' for the game in some old papers once given him by coin machine</pre><pre>pioneer Tom Watling, Watling having told him that LOG CABIN dated back to</pre><pre>1884!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bill then remarked that the game was very similar to what he called</pre><pre>"the very first counter pinball" BINGO built by Leo Berman in 1930.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He</pre><pre>then compared various features of LOG CABIN with those of other pingames of</pre><pre>the early 1930's.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that point Rob began discussing the BINGO game, first telling</pre><pre>of another article by Bill Gersh in which he implied that LOG CABIN and the</pre><pre>Leo Berman BINGO were "for all intents and purposes, duplicates" - also</pre><pre>remarking that the play action and scoring on both machines were the same. </pre><pre>Rob then commented that "in the search for the first pingame the question</pre><pre>to be answered is not the machine's links to earlier similar types of</pre><pre>games, but more importantly, who originally manufactured the game in</pre><pre>question; and more importantly yet, when it was first produced, patented,</pre><pre>or advertised".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Information was then presented covering several versions of the</pre><pre>"BINGO game", including a copyright infringement suit brought and won by</pre><pre>Dave Gottlieb of D.

</span>First, the plane surface was slightly tilted (the balls rolling</pre><pre>towards the bottom).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the scoring holes were partially surrounded</pre><pre>with "hedges of brass nails", thus increasing the skill required by the</pre><pre>player.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Rob's final comment on the subject of WHOOPEE was that "the first</pre><pre>documented pinball game quickly faded from the amusement machine field" </pre><pre>Rob then attributed this to two factors:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>And after winning his court</pre><pre>case over Leo Berman regarding his BINGO BALL game, Dave decided to improve</pre><pre>that game, coming up with a 'tabloid size', walnut-boxed game called BAFFLE</pre><pre>BALL.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then remarked that BAFFLE BALL used many of the same elements</pre><pre>as its predecessor, but the difference was that it was the first such game</pre><pre>to be mass marketed and nationally advertised!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented that</pre><pre>BAFFLE BALL was "the first game to reach large numbers of depression-</pre><pre>haggard Americans."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went on to say that because of the pressures of the</pre><pre>time, all were eager to escape their woes and exchange one cent for the fun</pre><pre>of shooting seven balls.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After saying that BAFFLE BALL "took America by storm" (50,000</pre><pre>being sold at $17.50 in less than a year) Rob commented that this was</pre><pre>primarily for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, it was cheap to play, and second the</pre><pre>cost of the machine was low and operators could afford to buy it.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next commented "competition quickly erupted" telling how in</pre><pre>late 1931 Raymond T. Maloney convinced his partners in a small Chicago</pre><pre>print shop "to join him in a bold adventure".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This resulted in the</pre><pre>production of a counter-top pingame called BALLYHOO - the name coming from</pre><pre>a satire magazine of the period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then said that at first those games</pre><pre>were produced for them by Gottlieb, but when 50,000 were sold in seven</pre><pre>months Maloney incorporated Bally Manufacturing (named for the game) to</pre><pre>produce them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then added that Bally sold the game for $16.50 to compete</pre><pre>with Gottlieb's BAFFLE BALL.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An April 1932 article describing BALLYHOO's success was then</pre><pre>quoted from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The article began by saying that since automatic games have</pre><pre>"taken a place in the amusement world, attention should be given to the use</pre><pre>of showmanship in their marketing".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It then cited BALLYHOO as a good</pre><pre>example of that, remarking that the game itself had "flash and ballyhoo". </pre><pre>Rob then commented that the success of BAFFLE BALL and BALLYHOO in 1931 and</pre><pre>early 1932 started "what was to become 'the first pinball craze'".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This in</pre><pre>turn, he went on, spawned a "boom" in the coin machine business while other</pre><pre>businesses were going "bust".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was then remarked by Rob that coin machines had been around for</pre><pre>decades (maybe centuries) with vending machines somewhat commonly known</pre><pre>since around 1822; but, he said, there was no "skill" involved in operating</pre><pre>them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pingames, he then commented, gave their users a chance to use their</pre><pre>skill by skillfully ejecting the ball onto the playfield using the plunger,</pre><pre>and then nudging it around the field to get it into the highest scoring</pre><pre>holes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, he then added, these games offered their players "the thrill</pre><pre>of success", as well as sometimes being able to win money, merchandise, or</pre><pre>free games.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then commented that pinball machines "became a windfall of</pre><pre>copper and nickel" for their owners, saying that games like BAFFLE BALL and</pre><pre>BALLYHOO usually paid back their under $20 cost in the first week of</pre><pre>operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that although pennies are considered a "nuisance"</pre><pre>today, impossible as it may be to believe, "fortunes" were made from them</pre><pre>by the early pinball operators, adding that those "coin-operated Bagatelle</pre><pre>boards" were to the 1930's what fast food franchises were to the 1960's.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An editorial article written by a Billboard coin machine editor</pre><pre>who called himself "Silver Sam" was next quoted from, telling what he</pre><pre>thought about the future of the amusement machine field after attending the</pre><pre>March 1932 coin machine convention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sam was said to have remarked that the</pre><pre>convention "indicated clearly that the coin machine trade was predominantly</pre><pre>amusement machine minded" and also that "pingames were far in the lead". </pre><pre>He then attributed the success of the new pingames to four factors: action,</pre><pre>suspense, skill, and flash.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rob next commented that the success of games like BAFFLE BALL and</pre><pre>BALLYHOO<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>could also be attributed to other factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, he said, was</pre><pre>their low price - a minimum investment allowing almost anyone to "re-enter</pre><pre>the world of work" during the Depression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next, he said their small size</pre><pre>allowed them to be placed on counters in various retail establishments -</pre><pre>their size also making them easy to transport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he commented that</pre><pre>they were mechanically rather simple and required little skill to maintain.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Due to these factors, Rob went on, it can be seen why those</pre><pre>devices were so successful during the Depression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And because of that</pre><pre>success, a large variety of pingames began to appear on the market in the</pre><pre>early years of that decade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that by the beginning of 1932 the</pre><pre>number of advertisements in Billboard for those types of games was often in</pre><pre>the twenties or thirties!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then briefly mentioned several of those</pre><pre>early pingames (SKILL-O, JOSTLE, VARIETY, HI-BALL, and LUCKY STAR) also</pre><pre>providing full-page illustrations of their advertisements.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last part of the chapter told of some of the typical locations</pre><pre>where those early pingames could be found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These included: roadside</pre><pre>stands, bus and rail depots, gas stations, cafes, drug stores, tobacco</pre><pre>stores, and barber shops.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After commenting that "the competition between these early games</pre><pre>soon became stiff", Rob said that to stimulate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>play, operators and</pre><pre>location owners started offering prizes (merchandise, cash, or free plays)</pre><pre>to skillful players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This, Rob ended by saying, led to the need for "anti-</pre><pre>cheating devices" which "stimulated the beginning of 'the decade of</pre><pre>innovation'" - the subject of the next chapter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>The first "innovation" to be discussed in this chapter was "the</pre><pre>mechanical tilt".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob began by remarking "the very term ('tilt') brings a</pre><pre>grimace of frustration to the face of any pinball player, even today"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He</pre><pre>then added that the term was descriptive of the game being raised off the</pre><pre>counter and "tilted" in order to try and control the movement of the ball.</pre><pre>After commenting that the first tilt mechanisms were simple devices that</pre><pre>worked on gravity, Rob said that some were simple arrows under the glass</pre><pre>which pointed to either "OK" or "TILT" when the game was "disturbed by the</pre><pre>player".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then described two early types of tilt mechanisms, both</pre><pre>utilizing small metal balls.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first (and I believe the most common) type of tilt mechanism</pre><pre>described consisted of a small hemispherical "well" located on the lower</pre><pre>end of the playfield which, had a small metal rod protruding into it at</pre><pre>its center, and containing a small steel ball of a larger diameter than</pre><pre>the rod.

</span>He then summarized</pre><pre>the operation of the relay by saying that it is used to "take electrical</pre><pre>current (allowed to flow by the closing of one switch) and "relay" it to</pre><pre>several other circuits by causing additional switches to open or close".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>By 1936, Rob then commented, the first "illustrated" backglass was</pre><pre>used on a game called PEARL HARBOR - prior backboards being decorated only</pre><pre>with simple geometric patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He ended the discussion of backboards</pre><pre>naming some typical themes depicting "contemporary life" of the period</pre><pre>including: CHICAGO EXPRESS, TRAFFIC, FLYING TRAPEZE, and HOLLYWOOD.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final sub-section describing advancements to pingames in the</pre><pre>1930's was titled simply "Bumper".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob began that discussion by commenting</pre><pre>that 1937 was the year in which "the industry was bumped from its</pre><pre>momentary slump in innovations".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then began describing what he called</pre><pre>"a totally new concept in the pinball industry" which was brought about by</pre><pre>Bally Manufacturing.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up until that time, Rob remarked, playfields had mainly consisted</pre><pre>of scoring holes - balls landing in them remaining there until the next</pre><pre>game was started (or occasionally kicked into a higher scoring hole by a</pre><pre>solenoid activated kicker).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In January 1937, he went on, Bally produced</pre><pre>the first "pinless", "pocketless" pingame which was called BUMPER.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next described the new scoring device Bally introduced on that</pre><pre>game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said the playfield of BUMPER was clustered with 12 posts each</pre><pre>having a coiled spring hanging vertically from its center - adding that</pre><pre>this device itself was called a "bumper".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that each of these</pre><pre>"bumpers" could record the touch of a ball from any side of it.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Describing its action in more detail, Rob told how when a ball</pre><pre>struck any point on the spring, it caused the lower end of it to close an</pre><pre>electrical contact which advanced the player's score.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then remarked</pre><pre>that BUMPER had several innovative features in addition to its unique</pre><pre>playfield arrangement with its bumpers.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most important of these other innovations Rob said was a</pre><pre>"totally new method of recording the score".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then described this device</pre><pre>as "a clever stereopticon device" - employing an elaborate back-projected</pre><pre>system involving a lamp, an opaque disc with clear numbers which rotated</pre><pre>each time a ball hit a bumper, and lenses to project the score (in units of</pre><pre>'10') onto an opaque glass mounted in the game's backboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then</pre><pre>commented that BUMPER also employed an electrified tilt mechanism which</pre><pre>indicated by a light on the backglass if the game was "bumped too hard".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then commented that the new electrical scoring system and the</pre><pre>bumper introduced on BUMPER were soon adopted by other manufacturers, and</pre><pre>that the success of this new idea caused some manufacturers to "refit"</pre><pre>older games to that system - even Bally "reissued" its 1933 hit AIRWAY as</pre><pre>a "bumper game".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The section of the chapter dealing with game innovations ended</pre><pre>with some comments from Rob concerning how the pinball industry was</pre><pre>affected by them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First he said these innovations made it possible for the</pre><pre>industry to produce "games which were more interesting and complex enough</pre><pre>to sustain playtime without the use of prizes and cash awards".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then remarked that because many jurisdictions at that time</pre><pre>were passing laws outlawing pingames as "gambling devices", manufacturers</pre><pre>began to stress pinball play as a form of amusement. He ended by quoting</pre><pre>from the pinball history and art exhibition catalog TILT from 1975 in which</pre><pre>he said the author, Pat McCarthy, "summarized the period quite well".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The quote began by saying that in the mid-1930's pinball companies</pre><pre>began replacing "prizes" for skillful play by automatic awards of "free</pre><pre>games" - the locations soon discovering that this made the game more</pre><pre>popular with players than the more difficult prize awarding models.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The author of the article continued by remarking that even though</pre><pre>more people began playing for amusement, many operators still redeemed</pre><pre>"free games" for cash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This, he said, "aroused in officials an antagonism</pre><pre>toward pinball that persisted in many places to the present time".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The</pre><pre>quoted part of the article ended with a comment that many companies who had</pre><pre>previously manufactured pingames began to "retire from the field" around</pre><pre>that time - resulting in one of the "periodic slumps", with many</pre><pre>manufacturers beginning to "diversify their operations".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>In the last issue of Coin Slot I described Rob Hawkins' thesis on</pre><pre>the history of pinball up through the middle of Chapter 4 concluding Rob's</pre><pre>discussion of some of the electrical components of pinball machines.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section of that Chapter was titled "The Pinball Machine</pre><pre>As Hero and Outlaw".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob began that section by commenting that the</pre><pre>innovations in pingames during the mid 1930's resulted in the game being</pre><pre>changed into a "marvel of mechanical ingenuity" with the addition of</pre><pre>electricity greatly increasing the popularity of the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he said,</pre><pre>the new games began to be accused of being gambling devices, being outlawed</pre><pre>in some places.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This, Rob continued, resulted in police raids and public</pre><pre>demonstrations of politicians smashing machines in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The outlawing,</pre><pre>he then remarked, often occurred in courtrooms and occasionally at the</pre><pre>ballot box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, in spite of all this, he said, the game still remained a</pre><pre>"hero" to many people.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next began a sub-section called "Hero Images".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said</pre><pre>that the increasing popularity of pingames also caused an increase in the</pre><pre>form of newspaper/magazine articles, cartoons, plays, and then movies in</pre><pre>most of which the game "played the roll of a hero".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then began</pre><pre>describing cartoons depicting pingames.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob said that one of the earliest such cartoons (which was</pre><pre>reprinted in Billboard) originally appeared in a New York City daily</pre><pre>newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was said to have been precipitated by the use at the time of</pre><pre>pingames in the psychiatric wards of city hospitals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cartoon (which</pre><pre>Rob illustrated) showed a patient who was offered a "bagatelle" game by a</pre><pre>doctor refusing it saying "it's one of those things that got me this way!". </pre><pre>Another cartoon showed customers at a drug store lunch counter using a</pre><pre>"Bagatelle" to aid them in selecting a sandwich.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next sub-topic was "Do It Yourself Pinball".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An article was</pre><pre>described from Popular Mechanics in 1937 on the construction of a home-made</pre><pre>pingame called TRIP EM', which even included a simple electric "kicker". </pre><pre>Rob also showed the cover from another do-it-yourself magazine of the</pre><pre>period which showed a pingame, the construction of which was included in</pre><pre>the magazine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That game was called TRAFFIC BAGATELLE.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next sub-section was headed "The Pins In Plays and Movies". </pre><pre>Rob began by mentioning a play called "Glory For All" which was put on in</pre><pre>Philadelphia in 1937 which featured, according to a Billboard article, "a</pre><pre>bagatelle game as an integral part of the stage setting".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then went on</pre><pre>to mention what was probably the most significant use of a pingame in a</pre><pre>play, the 1939 play by famed playwright William Saroyan "The Time Of Your</pre><pre>Life".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob commented that Saroyan "immortalized" the pinball machine in</pre><pre>that play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that Mr. Saroyan lived in New York while writing</pre><pre>the play and that it took place in "Nick's Pacific Street Saloon" (which</pre><pre>was supposed to be in San Francisco, by the way) which had a pinball</pre><pre>machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told how in the last act when one of the characters</pre><pre>finally "beat the machine" it "performed all sorts of electrical</pre><pre>gymnastics, including playing The Star Spangled Banner".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The play was later made into a movie, Rob then commented, and</pre><pre>Bally created special large pingames with the same name which were set up</pre><pre>in some theater lobbies to help promote a cancer fund raising drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob</pre><pre>then told of another movie, "Sensations of 1945", which he said "was</pre><pre>applicable to the hero image of the pinball machine".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob ended his discussion of pingames as "heros" by remarking that</pre><pre>the games took "many forms" in that context - that of movie star, key stage</pre><pre>prop, and cartoon subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented that pinball as an "outlaw"</pre><pre>took only one form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This he said was "that of a villainous thief with</pre><pre>connections to the underworld through its older brother the slot machine". </pre><pre>That set the scene for the next sub-section "The Pinball As An Outlaw".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob began that sub-section by saying that as early as 1933</pre><pre>pingames were beginning to be associated with slot machines, even though</pre><pre>operators insisted they were "games of skill".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem, he went on,</pre><pre>was that many pinball operators, and even some machines, provided prizes</pre><pre>for high scores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, he continued, some public officials</pre><pre>began a "war on gambling" which often included pins as well as slots.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By the late 1930's, Rob went on, "the great crackdown came" saying</pre><pre>that police often raided gambling machines, many times smashing them with</pre><pre>hammers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that by that time laws had been passed in many</pre><pre>localities prohibiting coin-op gambling devices, which resulted in many</pre><pre>"test cases" in the courts - some judges declaring pins were "gambling</pre><pre>devices", others ruling they were "amusement games".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next commented that in most cases the question of whether</pre><pre>pingames were gambling or amusement devices was settled at the local level. </pre><pre>He then said that, rather than trying to review all laws pertaining to the</pre><pre>legality of pins, he had selected New York City and Los Angeles as "sample</pre><pre>cases" for discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then commented that both of these cities banned</pre><pre>pinball within three years of each other, but that the methods used and the</pre><pre>length of time required to accomplish the bans varied greatly - adding that</pre><pre>the mayors of both cities participated in the task.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The next sub-section, "The Los Angeles Method", began with Rob</pre><pre>saying that that city did not attempt to ban pingames until 1939.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before</pre><pre>that year, he went on, pinball had been quite popular in Los Angeles, with</pre><pre>articles being published in national magazines showing Hollywood</pre><pre>celebrities amusing themselves with pingames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He next described one such</pre><pre>article.</pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then remarked that just prior to the beginning of the push to</pre><pre>ban pins in Los Angeles several large national magazines carried articles</pre><pre>"which portrayed Los Angeles in a bad light" - one in Saturday Evening Post</pre><pre>covering "gambling boats" and one in Look which labeled Los Angeles as "the</pre><pre>wickedest city in the world".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Right after that (September 1939) Rob said</pre><pre>was when the Los Angeles Police Commission proposed an ordinance banning</pre><pre>pingames to the City Council - but whether this was a result of the "bad</pre><pre>publicity", or a recent similar ban passed in Pasadena Rob said could not</pre><pre>be determined.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The "three official rationales" for the new proposed law were then</pre><pre>described - "controlling vice and corruption in the city", "the high cost</pre><pre>of police to curb illegal machine gambling", and "school children playing</pre><pre>the games".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon afterward, Rob went on, the commissions's "crusade" was</pre><pre>joined by Mayor Fletcher Bowron - a local newspaper article being quoted</pre><pre>from, in which the mayor challenged the Look Magazine statements regarding</pre><pre>the "wickedness" of the city.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Soon after the new ordnance was proposed, Rob commented, the local</pre><pre>"California Amusement Machine Operator's Association" (CAMOA) began their</pre><pre>offensive - sponsoring an "educational forum" to allow open discussion of</pre><pre>the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CAMOA claimed "marble games are trade stimulators, rent payers,</pre><pre>and skill games, just as good for the public as the stock market or bowling</pre><pre>bets, and less of a public bleeder than horse races".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next said that Mayor Bowron quickly responded to CAMOA</pre><pre>charging them with "streamlined lobbying" and claiming that gamblers were</pre><pre>"making an effort to reorganize their forces".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After more public</pre><pre>bickering, he continued, a closely divided City Council voted to hold a</pre><pre>public hearing on the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This hearing, he said, brought on a deluge of</pre><pre>letters and 750 citizens who came to argue against the "marble boards".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still unable to make a decision, Rob then said, the Council voted</pre><pre>to hold a "special election" on December 12, 1939 to put the issue to a</pre><pre>public vote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the ballot proposition was shown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the weeks</pre><pre>before the election, he continued, more "bickering" between both sides took</pre><pre>place - especially between the Mayor and CAMOA which was described in some</pre><pre>detail.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the election took place, Rob commented, only about 30 percent</pre><pre>of the registered voters voted, with the anti-pinball ordinance being</pre><pre>passed 16,264 to 112,709, which was considered "a triumph for Bowron". </pre><pre>Pingame operators were then given about a week to remove their games from</pre><pre>the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then remarked that pins remained illegal in Los Angeles for</pre><pre>34 years when the ordnance was challenged in court and overturned in 1973 -</pre><pre>resulting in "the emergence of pinball parlors, and the birth of a new</pre><pre>generation of pinball wizards".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next started discussing "The New York Way" by saying that</pre><pre>city's confrontation with pingames and slots extended over a period of</pre><pre>about 10 years (1932 - 1942). During that period, he went on, many people</pre><pre>viewed both types of machines as "one in the same" - pointing out that the</pre><pre>New York Times Index for that period included all articles relating to pins</pre><pre>under the heading "slot machines".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then quoted from an article in the</pre><pre>New York Times Magazine describing early pingames as "games of skill". </pre><pre>But, he went on, because some early pins issued cash awards they were soon</pre><pre>lumped with slot machines.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then said that New York City's attempt to rid itself of</pre><pre>gambling devices began early in 1932 when both the Grand Jury Association</pre><pre>and the District Attorney's Association came out for stronger laws against</pre><pre>slot machines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the months that followed, Rob said,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this "war on</pre><pre>gambling" resulted in the seizure of 239 slot machines (of the 20 to 30</pre><pre>thousand estimated to be in the city at that time), many of those being</pre><pre>destroyed.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May of 1933, Rob went on, a judge issued an injunction</pre><pre>restraining police from seizing slot machines, ending the city's first</pre><pre>drive to do away with gambling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the temporary cessation of the drive</pre><pre>didn't last too long, he continued, because early in 1934 a police</pre><pre>department "shake up" resulted in another "anti-slot drive".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then in early 1934, Rob said, the court curbed the police gambling</pre><pre>drive even further by making a distinction between "bagatelle games" and</pre><pre>"slot machines" - saying that the former were "games of skill".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was</pre><pre>about that time that Fiorello La Guardia, who was to play a major part in</pre><pre>the city's anti-gambling crusade, was elected Mayor and the crusade</pre><pre>continued.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next told of a June 1935 article in a New York newspaper</pre><pre>describing a courtroom anti-pingame case in which three "expert" players</pre><pre>failed to convince a Bronx judge that pinball was a "game of skill".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The</pre><pre>result was that a candy store proprietor was found guilty of "maintaining a</pre><pre>room for gambling".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That, he said, was "the first legal ruling in New York</pre><pre>City against pinball based on a lack of skill".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The day after that ruling, Rob then said, Mayor La Guardia held a</pre><pre>news conference on a New York pier, after which he and members of the</pre><pre>police commission proceeded to smash some confiscated slot machines, then</pre><pre>dumping them into Long Island Sound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After that, he went on, the Mayor</pre><pre>gave instructions to his License Commissioner to stop issuing licenses for</pre><pre>pin or bagatelle games like those covered by the recent court decision.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This licensing ban, Rob next commented, was challenged in court</pre><pre>which upheld the commission's action as to games which issued tokens as</pre><pre>"awards" - declaring those games to be "gambling devices".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ruling, Rob</pre><pre>said, did however specifically differentiate games which allowed players to</pre><pre>earn rewards of prizes or merchandise as not coming under the ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This</pre><pre>did not discourage the Mayor, Rob remarked, from instructing the license</pre><pre>commissioner to "clean out all machines covered by the decision ("token</pre><pre>payout" games) and to revoke licenses of places which operated them - also</pre><pre>ordering the police to seize all such machines".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next said that 1936 "proved to be a trying time for pinball</pre><pre>operators and location owners alike".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In January, he went on, a Bronx</pre><pre>court defined pins as "gambling devices" allowing the Mayor to order a ban</pre><pre>on all such games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the commissioner then suspended licenses on</pre><pre>pingames (and vowed to inspect all small stores for them), Rob said that</pre><pre>operators obtained a court order for a hearing on the commissioner's right</pre><pre>to suspend the licenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The commissioner agreed to delay his suspensions</pre><pre>until the court ruled.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a postponement, Rob went on, the court found that operating</pre><pre>pinballs for prizes was prohibited by state gambling laws and denied the</pre><pre>injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Court, he then said, upheld the commissioner's</pre><pre>right to revoke licenses resulting in thirty locations being closed and</pre><pre>forty more warned to remove "illegal features" from their games.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next said that in June 1936 the commissioner stated that</pre><pre>machines may be operated provided they were licensed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor, he</pre><pre>continued, obtained the statement of a university professor who reported</pre><pre>that the results of 97,900 supervised tests at the university determined</pre><pre>that pinball was a game of "chance" and not of "skill".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This, Rob then</pre><pre>remarked, had no effect and an "uneasy truce" existed for the next six</pre><pre>years between "the guardians of public morals" and the pinball operators.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next event in the "pinball wars", Rob said, was a March 1941</pre><pre>ban on pingames in Teaneck New Jersey which in October was challenged by a</pre><pre>pinball distributor and a restaurant owner who had lost a machine in a</pre><pre>police raid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Township Manager, he then said, retained the same</pre><pre>university professor as his "expert witness".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At about this same time, Rob then commented, pinball was "getting</pre><pre>into trouble again in New York City", and also had "setbacks on a national</pre><pre>level".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In November, he said, New York again attempted to outlaw the game</pre><pre>in another court case, and in December the Federal Office Of Production</pre><pre>Management curtailed amusement machine production by 75 percent due to "the</pre><pre>world situation".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 1942, Rob then commented, the New York City Police</pre><pre>again began raiding pinball machines when a court ruled they were "gambling</pre><pre>devices".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He showed the infamous photo of the Mayor knocking over a seized</pre><pre>pingame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early that year, he continued, there was a flurry of anti-pinball</pre><pre>activity with injunctions, confiscations, etc., causing "the pinball</pre><pre>machine to fall from grace in New York City" and being "outlawed</pre><pre>completely"!</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The worst, Rob said, was yet to come, telling of the New Jersey</pre><pre>Supreme Court upholding the city of Teaneck's outlawing pingames as</pre><pre>gambling devices - the testimony of that university professor being used to</pre><pre>convince the court that pingames were not primarily games of skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob</pre><pre>then quoted from a personal correspondence he received from the professor</pre><pre>telling of his recollections of the case which included an anonymous mail</pre><pre>death threat he received at the time.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chapter ended with Rob telling of the final complete wartime</pre><pre>ban on amusement machine production by the War Production Board on March</pre><pre>16, 1942.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said at that time the pinball machine was "truly an</pre><pre>outlaw - outlawed in Los Angeles by popular vote, in New York City through</pre><pre>the constant efforts of the police and the Mayor, in New Jersey by the</pre><pre>testimony of a physics professor, and finally totally by the War Production</pre><pre>Board".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, Rob concluded, pinball remained a "hero" after the war,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and</pre><pre>came to life again, and thanks to Mr. Harry Mabs, pinball is now legal in</pre><pre>all the above mentioned cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Rob began the chapter by remarking that even after the wartime ban</pre><pre>on pinball production was lifted the industry still was "plagued with</pre><pre>shortages".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, he continued, the wartime predictions of few post-war</pre><pre>innovations proved to be true, it not being until late in 1947 that</pre><pre>anything significant happened to pingames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was, he said, the</pre><pre>invention<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of the flipper by Gottlieb designer Harry Mabs.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob began a section titled "The Flipper" by stating that the main</pre><pre>purpose of adding flippers to pingames was to "provide the player with the</pre><pre>chance to exercise skill" during play of the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was done, he said,</pre><pre>to try to avoid "legal entanglements" related to "games of chance".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He</pre><pre>then began telling of previous attempts to provide "player control" to</pre><pre>pingames.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1932, Rob then commented, Rockola came out with a game called</pre><pre>JUGGLE BALL which had a player operated "stick" with which he could attempt</pre><pre>to alter the course of the ball - a game he said which was not too</pre><pre>successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that it wasn't until October 1947 that another</pre><pre>attempt at player control was tried - a Bally game called NUDGY having a</pre><pre>player-controlled electro-mechanical device which could move the entire</pre><pre>playfield by a small amount - this he said was also unsuccessful.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next remarked that it was only a month after NUDGY came out</pre><pre>that Gottlieb introduced the flipper on HUMPTY DUMPTY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This game, he went</pre><pre>on, containing six flippers, gave the player "a greater degree of control</pre><pre>over the ball" by allowing him to activate a set of flippers (there were 2</pre><pre>sets of 3 - one on each side) at "critical moments of play" which could</pre><pre>"make the difference between a low score and that capable of winning a</pre><pre>replay".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then went into more detail on how these flippers could be used</pre><pre>by the players.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After quoting from a 1966 Esquire article "Mother Was A Pinball</pre><pre>Machine", describing a player skillfully using flippers during a game, Rob</pre><pre>commented that "control of the ball is a large part of the pinball game". </pre><pre>He ended his discussion of flippers by pointing out that their introduction</pre><pre>certainly did much to help the pinball machine distinguish itself from</pre><pre>"gambling devices" which had legal problems in many areas.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section of the chapter, "The Evolution Of The Bumper",</pre><pre>began with Rob remarking that the old "spring type" bumpers, originally</pre><pre>introduced in 1936, underwent several changes after the war, evolving into</pre><pre>"two distinct new types".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first of these he referred to as "Mushroom</pre><pre>Bumpers". (Author's Note: I believe Rob himself coined that term to</pre><pre>describe "un-powered" plastic bumpers, because that term was not used by</pre><pre>the industry, I believe, until years later when Bally introduced an</pre><pre>entirely new type of bumper which they called by that name).</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob began a subsection titled "Mushroom Bumpers" by saying that</pre><pre>they were "the simpler of the two types" and had the identical scoring</pre><pre>capabilities of the original "spring type" - but were "totally different"</pre><pre>in form".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then began describing their configuration in detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said</pre><pre>they had a plastic ring slightly above the playfield which when struck from</pre><pre>any direction by a ball would cause an electrical switch under the</pre><pre>playfield to close, thus scoring points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went on to tell how many of</pre><pre>those bumpers could be illuminated by an internal light bulb, a lit bumper</pre><pre>often signifying that its scoring value had been increased (usually by a</pre><pre>factor of 10).</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next subsection, "Thumper Bumpers", began with Rob saying that</pre><pre>that form of bumper was activated much the same way as the type previously</pre><pre>described, but that it had a solenoid coil incorporated into it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then</pre><pre>described how, when activated by a ball, the circuit to the solenoid is</pre><pre>also completed which causes a metal ring near the top of the bumper</pre><pre>assembly to be "yanked downward forcibly" causing the ball to be "driven</pre><pre>violently away" from the bumper.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob next remarked that this kicking away of the ball by the</pre><pre>"Thumper Bumper" was the "major difference between the two types of bumpers</pre><pre>developed after the war."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented that the first use of the</pre><pre>"Thumper Bumper" was probably on an Exhibit Supply pingame called CIRCUS</pre><pre>which came out in 1948.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre>(Author's Note: While that game may have had a form of "thumper bumper" it</pre><pre>probably was not of the construction Rob described, as Exhibit's CONTACT</pre><pre>(which came out at about the same time) utilized a powered bumper of a</pre><pre>radically different construction)</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section of the chapter was titled "Raising The Score". </pre><pre>Rob began this short section by telling of several factors which he said</pre><pre>"aided the industry in eliminating the gambling image that was prevalent</pre><pre>during the late Thirties" - factors which he said also "assisted in</pre><pre>acquiring/maintaining player interest in the games".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then said that the use of "replay units" on almost all games</pre><pre>(and the virtual elimination of coin payouts on pingames) was one such</pre><pre>factor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The other major factor, he then went on, was the addition<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of</pre><pre>flippers which incorporated more player skill into the game, and also aided</pre><pre>in changing the games's image at that time.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next chapter section, titled "Pinball Themes in Backglasses</pre><pre>and Board Design", Rob began by commenting that "the name, theme, and</pre><pre>design of the backglass and playboard were all inter-related in an</pre><pre>ingenious fashion in the pinball machines that were produced during the</pre><pre>'Golden Years'".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then went on to say that the name of the game "set the</pre><pre>theme for the machine's design, which was then carried out in the 'scoring</pre><pre>artwork' and the form of the 'scoring objectives' on the playfield".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As his first example of this Rob used Genco's ROCKET of 1950,</pre><pre>telling how the backglass was decorated with planets, rockets, etc., with</pre><pre>nine rockets being used to indicate each 100,000 score increment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three</pre><pre>planets on the backglass, he went on, illustrated one, two, and three</pre><pre>million scores - then describing how the lighting of these rockets and</pre><pre>planets indicated the player's current score.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The playfield artwork was</pre><pre>next described in detail which also fitted in with the game's theme</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As his next example Rob used Gottlieb's BARNACLE BILL from 1948,</pre><pre>with a "crusty old sea captain" as its main subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then described</pre><pre>the backglass art as consisting of "boats, a lighthouse, and a pier on</pre><pre>which Barnacle Bill stood banging on the door of a multi-storied brothel". </pre><pre>He then told how the one-hundred-thousand scores were shown on pennants</pre><pre>waiving above the brothel, while the 10,000's were shown on life</pre><pre>preservers.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After mentioning the nautical items illustrated on BARNACLE BILL's</pre><pre>playfield, Rob ended the section by reiterating that games of that period</pre><pre>had their backglass scoring indications "blended into the theme", each</pre><pre>being separately illuminated as game scores advanced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then added that</pre><pre>"it was this total coordination of all aspects of the game that became the</pre><pre>trademark of machines manufactured during 'The Golden Years'".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section of the chapter, "Animated Backglasses", began</pre><pre>with Rob remarking that the "idea of total coordination was taken one step</pre><pre>further when backglasses began to incorporate 'animation'" -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>which he said</pre><pre>also had to "maintain the theme" of the game".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then remarked that</pre><pre>Gottlieb became quite adept at incorporating this feature (animation).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob</pre><pre>then illustrated his point by describing the animation used on Gottlieb's</pre><pre>1948 game ALI BABA.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Turning to another Gottlieb game of the same year,</pre><pre>CINDERELLA, he told of its animation involving "the gradual changing of a</pre><pre>pumpkin into a modern automobile".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob ended that section by commenting that the game designers and</pre><pre>manufacturers "soon realized that they could incorporate methods other than</pre><pre>high score to award replays".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This, he said, involved a prerequisite that</pre><pre>"those methods had to be sufficiently complex to entice the player, yet not</pre><pre>make it too easy to win replays".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next sub-section of the chapter was titled "Multi-method</pre><pre>Replays".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob began by saying that what became known as "Special Features"</pre><pre>were employed in many "Golden Years machines".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These features, he went on,</pre><pre>allowed players to win replays by getting a ball to drop into a certain</pre><pre>hole or hit a certain target.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob went on to say that there was always a</pre><pre>"prerequisite" - such as requiring the player to get a ball "through a</pre><pre>series of gates, or to hit a series of targets - sometimes even in a</pre><pre>particular order".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then gave some examples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was Bally's CARNIVAL in</pre><pre>1948 where a player could score a replay by getting a ball to go over a</pre><pre>rollover switch on the playfield provided a certain "sequence" of five</pre><pre>bumpers had been previously hit (and lit).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He next went into much detail</pre><pre>on the various ways in which replays could be made on Gottlieb's SITTIN'</pre><pre>PRETTY (1958) - Rob's first pingame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by a description of</pre><pre>the "light animation" on its backglass.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The part of the chapter telling of pinballs "Golden Years" ended</pre><pre>with Rob remarking that the Golden Years concluded with the advent of "drum</pre><pre>scoring".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then described these score-indicating devices in detail, also</pre><pre>commenting that when these were used it was no longer necessary to</pre><pre>"integrate the score into the backglass theme".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 1958, Rob then</pre><pre>commented, the Golden Years had come to an end and the pinball machine was</pre><pre>"again undergoing changes which would drastically alter the appearance of</pre><pre>the backglass".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final section of the chapter, titled "And After: 1958", began</pre><pre>with Rob remarking that "drum scoring" soon became "standard" throughout</pre><pre>the industry - which he said made games less expensive to produce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then</pre><pre>said that wooden legs and side rails were soon replaced with metal, further</pre><pre>reducing production costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proliferation of two and four player games</pre><pre>was also mentioned.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then told of various playfield "innovations" which began to</pre><pre>appear on pingames, such as "messenger balls", "captive balls", "spinners",</pre><pre>and "drop targets".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later ideas, he then continued, included ways of</pre><pre>"blocking" balls from the "outhole" - two such devices, the "playmore post"</pre><pre>and "zipper flippers" were then described in some detail.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A "totally new idea", Rob then remarked, was the use of a "video</pre><pre>playfield" - which he said was used by Chicago Coin on a game called SUPER</pre><pre>FLIPPER.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told how the entire playfield of this game was replaced</pre><pre>by a "television type screen".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob next described the operation of that</pre><pre>game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then commented "who is to say that in 10 years a device similar</pre><pre>to this involving a color picture tube, and other unforseen developments</pre><pre>will not be manufactured and become a raging success".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Rob then said that pinballs have also been part of that revival</pre><pre>- evidenced by a proliferation of pingames, pinball parlors, and even a</pre><pre>pinball rock opera - Tommy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These games, he went on, which were once</pre><pre>declared immoral and illegal, have returned to become a family recreation.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After commenting that this revival of pingames sparked an interest</pre><pre>in the games and the industry, Rob remarked that the lack of research and</pre><pre>documentation in that area is now apparent - adding that to date (1976)</pre><pre>there has been "no comprehensive work" published on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then</pre><pre>said that there were a few "superficial and often inaccurate" articles on</pre><pre>pins in popular publications, however.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then remarked that the trade journals indicate that at least</pre><pre>four books on the subject were in pre-production, but it was not known</pre><pre>whether they would be "comprehensive historical studies" or "superficial</pre><pre>industry surveys".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then said that the purpose of his study was to "fill</pre><pre>the void" and to "document the development of the pinball machine".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He next recounted the various information sources for his thesis,</pre><pre>including: trade journals, newspaper and magazine articles, personal</pre><pre>memories, and correspondence with industry figures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then described</pre><pre>possible areas where future research could be conducted to add to what he</pre><pre>had uncovered - also telling of some things which could make such endeavors</pre><pre>difficult.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then commented that his research has determined "that the</pre><pre>history of the pinball machine is both intriguing and multi-facetted" -</pre><pre>adding that it also "provides innumerable tangent forming potential</pre><pre>starting points for countless additional chapters".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told a little</pre><pre>about pinball's possible links to European games, especially "French</pre><pre>Bagatelle" - also talking of other similar "ancestors" of the modern</pre><pre>pingame.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After then mentioning the changing of those early games into "the</pre><pre>first pinball machine" - THE WHOOPEE GAME - Rob told how that game's demise</pre><pre>was caused by the economic conditions of the time, which also "provided the</pre><pre>impetus for the first real boom in coin-operated amusement machines".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He</pre><pre>then<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>commented that "as the popularity of these new machines spread,</pre><pre>technical advancements (in them) began to appear".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob then mentioned the technological advancements in pingames</pre><pre>which came about between 1931 and 1941, including the addition of</pre><pre>electricity (the greatest innovation since the game's inception), which he</pre><pre>said resulted in "changes in size, complexity, and popularity of the</pre><pre>games".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob then mentioned the problems which some of the games had with</pre><pre>legal considerations causing them to be "banned" in some localities.</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the start of World War II, Rob then continued, the production</pre><pre>of amusement machines was halted, with the factories turning to "production</pre><pre>of war-related materials"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the war, he went on, the refinement of the</pre><pre>replay mechanism, the introduction of "mushroom" and "thumper" bumpers, and</pre><pre>the invention of the flipper "created the 'Golden Years' era".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During that period (1947 - 1958) Rob said "the pinball machine</pre><pre>reached the pinnacle of complexity and creativeness".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told of the</pre><pre>integration of the score indicating numbers and the game's artwork theme</pre><pre>combining to make games of this period "artfully ingenious".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob next</pre><pre>remarked that the "player controlled flippers" which were introduced during</pre><pre>that period provided a "skill factor" which "soon began to break through</pre><pre>the legal barriers and again allow the game wide circulation".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob ended his summary by remarking that with the development of</pre><pre>the drum score counter "the Golden Years ended and an era of multi-player,</pre><pre>simplified backglass design, an generally lack-luster machines began". </pre><pre>Finally, he added the comment "innovations were few and far between with</pre><pre>only an occasional bright light - most developments were simply old ideas</pre><pre>reworked".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The "Conclusions" section contained a list of six major</pre><pre>conclusions of the study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>was that "the historical lineage of</pre><pre>the game probably dates back to medieval times and the European game of</pre><pre>Bagatelle".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Second was "the first pinball game was THE WHOOPEE GAME in</pre><pre>1929".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rob's third conclusion was that "the period 1931 - 1941 witnessed</pre><pre>the greatest number of innovations and developments in the game's</pre><pre>components and design".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rob's fourth conclusion was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that "the 'gambling issue' combined</pre><pre>with World War II caused an interruption in the evolution/production of</pre><pre>pinball machines". His fifth conclusion was that "the development of the</pre><pre>flipper in 1947 injected the element of 'skill' into the game and provided</pre><pre>the impetus for successfully challenging earlier court rulings which</pre><pre>declared the machines to be 'gambling devices'".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final conclusion Rob stated was that "the years 1948 - 1958</pre><pre>were 'The Golden Years' for pinball and witnessed more complex systems for</pre><pre>attaining high scores and replays and more elaborate backglass designs". </pre><pre>Rob then ended his thesis by remarking that "the history of the pinball</pre><pre>machine is an interesting one, intermeshed with the social, political, and</pre><pre>economic history of the country", adding "for nearly half a century the</pre><pre>pinball game<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- with numerous ups and downs - has been part of the American</pre><pre>scene".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then ended the chapter (and the body of the thesis) with some</pre><pre>lines from William Saroyan's play "The Time of Your Life".</pre><pre><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></pre><pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final part of the thesis consisted of a detailed Bibliography</pre><pre>listing all the references cited in the thesis, a detailed "Subject Index",</pre><pre>and copies of two personal letters Rob had received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One was from pioneer</pre><pre>coin-machine industry writer/publisher Bill Gersh, and the other from</pre><pre>Professor Clarence C.
